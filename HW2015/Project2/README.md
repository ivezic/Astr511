* Project2 notebooks go here

* Zeljko's solution is in HW2.py 
   - it produces figure Astr511HW2.png 
   - two pickle files are made if they don't exist (slow!): CminusZI.npz and CminusZIhalo.npz 
   - notebook HW2zi.ipynb might work but I haven't run it yet (some conflicts with python versions...)
